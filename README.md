# ElectricBubbles
The code is poorly commented - the main driver is electric.f
Geometry information about the initial set up is stored in the file "bubbin" & read in in the subroutine READINI
There are a lot of files - a bunch are for FMM, another set is for GMRES - it would be better to separate these off and make separate libraries for the two.
